# Apollo
Apollo will assist developers with building DBMSs that deliver robust performance, which will simplify the bug-reporting process for users. Therefore, we design A POLLO to contain three components: the fuzzing engine (SQLFuzz), the query minimization framework (SQLMin), and the diagnosis engine (SQLDebug).

# Sourcoe code will be added soon
